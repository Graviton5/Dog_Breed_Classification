# Dog_Breed_Classification

This Repository contains the assignment I did for Internship Application, Project_Files contain the pdf with the details of the assignment as well as the code that was written as submission. The model was not uploaded as it was too large for upload and dataset for download is available at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

The model works well for most dataset images as far as I know, but the actual validation dataset accuracy is low as there was a lot of varied data being generated from the Data Augmentation of the dataset and as the Assignment states this Classifier works on only 10 Breed of Dogs, namely, 

Beagle
Chihuahua
Doberman
French Bulldog
Golden Retriever
Malamute
Pug
Saint Bernard
Scottish Deerhound
Tibetan Mastiff
